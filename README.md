Creating a function to finding mean and standard deviation by removing Outliers

This is a simple fun experiment to find mean and standard deviation after removing Outliers with the desired cutoff

NOTE : A domain expert needs to be consulted before Outliers are being removed to get deeper understanding of the data.

We create a mean_std() function to find mean, standard deviation and then create validation() function to remove Outliers based on a cutoff value and find the new mean and std deviation
